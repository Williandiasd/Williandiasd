Hi therem my names willian i have 17 year I am a student at Alexandre de Gusmão's school, taking a course on systems development for two years. However, I still feel I'm not 50% or 100% experienced yet. But I want to achieve my goal of developing, learning to program, and creating my own applications.  👋
